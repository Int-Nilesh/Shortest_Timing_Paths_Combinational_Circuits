# Shortest-Timing-Paths-Combinational-Circuits
This C++ project parses ISCAS’85 netlists, extracts circuit parameters, and builds a weighted directed graph. It applies Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest timing paths based on fan-out delays. Supports netlist parsing, graph construction, and shortest path computation.
